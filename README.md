# Text Based Company System (C++)

The project is a university submission for a 100 level course (freshman level). The objective of this project is to demonstrate the following: 
* Object Oriented Programming in C++.
* The rule of 3 for memory management (destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator)
* Pointers, namespaces, and header files.

## Running the project

The project is currently available only as a Microsoft Visual Studio Solution. You will have to open the project with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or 2019, build the project and run it.


## Contributing & Possible Enhancements
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Possible enhancements include:  
* Accommodate the big 5 instead of the big 3, by introducing the move constructor and the move assignment operator.
* Introduce premake files to allow builds in different operating systems. Includes instructions on how to build.
* Better project setup.


Please make sure to update tests as appropriate if any exist.
